title: The South China Sea Dispute
---

China in recent times has been constructing artificial islands on the South China Sea. 
It is considered a very strategically important area south of China with vast reserves of gas and fisheries and a it is a very important trade route as one-third of the world's trade passes through it.
Major contested islands include the Spratly Islands, the Scaraborough Shoal and the Paracel Islands.

Now, according to the UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) every country has an area that which it has sole control upon extending to 200 miles from the coast which is the EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). A point worth noting is that China has also ratified it but is currently threatening to exit it.
Many countries such as Phillipines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Thailand have claims and legally some islands and waters fall within the EEZ.

Another factor involved is the USA's involvement there. It doesn't want to expressly get into conflict with China though it doesn't want their allies such as the Phillipines to be bullied by it either. So it has flouted Chinese claims with freedom of navigation operations.
Most of the countries and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) have made efforts to equivocate and maintain peace and so it hasn't escalated into armed conflict yet.
However, China says it used to control the waters from a very long time and it is an integral part of its territory. To support its claim it has produced the nine-dash line which covers nearly 90% of the South China Sea which apparently was made in 1949.

It has deployed military vessels and ships to construct the barely inhabited reefs into artificial islands where they are constructing airstrips, air defense systems and ports for its naval vessels. Take for instance, the Fiery Reef Islands. It is also in the process of implementing an aerial identification system over the islands and so it is asserting its sovereignty over the islands. Another cog in its grand scheme was recognising its territory nearest the South China Sea that is the Hainan Province and turining it into a tourist destination so it has more grounds for itself to gain traction while recognizing it.

The Arbitration Tribunal in the ICJ gave a judgement on the case brought to it by the Philippines regarding the legality of the nine-dash line and a few other matters of contention in the South China Sea. It noted that China has no historical claim to the waters based on the nine-dash line. China, as expected rejected the ruling.
 
It says that it is not doing it for military purposes but its actions imply otherwise. As seen its actions are only concentrated towards furthering its strategic motives in the area and exploiting the vast reserves of natural resources and fisheries as well as the quantum of trade that passes through it.

Our views on China's actions are that China is in clear violation of the sovereignty of the countries who should have proportionate control over various zones of the South China Sea. Therefore, the rights of the countries have been violated on multiple fronts and so Chinas has circumvented access to the resources to those countries sheerly on its military and diplomatic brawn. It has also prevented them increasing military deployment in this area. Some questions which arise as to the nine-dash line are that there are no co-ordinates, it is quite old for justification in this age and if it is to be believed then it is encroaching upon the waters demarcated as international waters by the UNCLOS. 
Essentially, it is bullying them in their own backyard and since none of the countries have enough military strength to challenge these claims it is mostly getting away with it. That is not to say that they shouldn't have access to the South China Sea but that it should share it with its neigbours while abiding with International Law and rulings which at this rate are flagrant violations of it.

A pattern that can be seen arising is that China in furthering its strategic interests is not averse to infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of other countries and using military force. Take for example, its recent adventurism in Doklam.
