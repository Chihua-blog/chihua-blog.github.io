title: Future of the EU
---

The European Union has faced a number of problems in the recent past. 
It has faced problems ranging from the refugee crisis in 2015, to nationalistic movements like Brexit. According to Eurobarometer 2015, 41% of European citizens identify themselves only with nationality, while a mere 1% identify with themselves as Europeans only. This just shows how much the opinion of people has swayed since when the EU was formed.

Donald Trump's election and Brexit has sparked the rise of other nationalistic groups in Europe. Politicians in Europe's radical right parties are looking and trying to replicate Trumps's tactics and applying then in their home countries. Some of them like Marine Le Pen have failed, while some are on the pathway to success.

The EU currently faces numerous challenges. But the EU has a history of muddling its way through them.

The future of the EU matters a lot on how the United Kingdom survives after Brexit. If it thrives and the European Union continues to worsen, a number of powerful countries in the EU may want to exit for their own benefits.

The attempt to stabilise currencies using the Euro failed in the past, and the EU was in a economic crisis. Although the Euro has recovered from this unprecedented shock, it is yet not stable enough and still prone to problems. The refugee crisis burdens border countries like Greece and Italy as refugees are suppossed to apply for asylum in the countries they first arrived in, according to EU regulations. The EU Relocation Scheme has not been particularly successful, and some countries have even opted out of it. Only 36% of irregular migrants are returned, thus making even lesser place for the refugees to stay.

Another concern which has been brought up a number of times is terrorism and refugees. People somehow relate refugees with terrorism, though this has been proved otherwise by a number of statistical sources.

Refugees being taken in by countries in the EU has raised a lot of concerns to the citizens. Population of countries believe that their "culture" is being weakened by refugees, most of whom don't even speak their language. The EU has constantly prepared funds to help these refugees; from 2015-16, over 9.2 billion euros were mobilised to help these refugees.

Movements which do not believe in humanitarian aid try to spread the message that the EU is a bureacritic monster, which gets its money from the pockets of the common man and uses the money in places which does not help them. The EU has been bearing the load of refugees since 2015, whose criticism is being increased day by day.

Part 1 of the Brexit negotiations is over. The current deal shows how powerful a hand the EU has. The second part, or the trade ties post Brexit is yet to begin. What happens in this will decide the future of UK-EU relations, which is going to be extremely important to the EU.

During the referendum, all the districts of Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to stay. Wales voted to leave, while all districts in England except London voted to leave. 

Scotland had held a referendum in 2014, on whether Scotland should be an independent country or a part of the United Kingdom. Those who voted to remain won by 56% against a 44% to leave. One of the biggest reasons why most voters voted to stay was because they wanted to remain a part of the EU; once they leave the UK they would have to reapply to the EU, thus taking formal procedures which would take time. Now that the UK is exiting the EU anyway, a second independence referendum has been proposed in Scotland. 

Similar referendums could also be held in Northern Ireland and London, but the chance of this happening is extremely less.

The coming future of the EU largely matters what happens to the Government of Germany, as many of their citizens are turning toward nationalistic ideals. How the EU handles the refugee crises and Brexit will also make an impression.

EU disintegration is more plausible than ever before.
