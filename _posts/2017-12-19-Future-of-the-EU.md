title: Future of the EU
---

The European Union has faced a number of problems in the recent past. 
It has faced problems ranging from the refugee crisis in 2015, to nationalistic movements like Brexit. According to Eurobarometer 2015, 41% of European citizens identify themselves only with nationality, while a mere 1% identify with themselves as Europeans only. This just shows how much the opinion of people has swayed since when the EU was formed.

Donald Trump's election and Brexit has sparked the rise of other nationalistic groups in Europe. Politicians in Europe's radical right parties are looking and trying to replicate Trumps's tactics and applying then in their home countries. Some of them like Marine Le Pen have failed, while some are on the pathway to success.

The EU currently faces numerous challenges. But the EU has a history of muddling its way through them.

The future of the EU matters a lot on how the United Kingdom survives after Brexit. If it thrives and the European Union continues to worsen, a number of powerful countries in the EU may want to exit for their own benefits.

The attempt to stabilise currencies using the Euro failed in the past, and the EU was in a economic crisis. Although the Euro has recovered from this unprecedented shock, it is yet not stable enough and still prone to problems. The refugee crisis burdens border countries like Greece and Italy as refugees are suppossed to apply for asylum in the countries they first arrived in, according to EU regulations. The EU Relocation Scheme has not been particularly successful, and some countries have even opted out of it. Only 36% of irregular migrants are returned, thus making even lesser place for the refugees to stay.
